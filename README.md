# Prediction-of-Stock-Price-Movement-based-on-trading-DS-II

Streamlit_exp
Deployment link: https://stock-price-prediction-svm1.herokuapp.com/


## AIM:  
The aim of our project is to build a Machine Learning model which aims to predict whether  the price in the next minute will go up or down, using the time series data of stock price,  technical-analysis indicators, and trading volume in the Stock market. 

## ABSTRACT: 
The ability to precisely predict the price movement of stocks is the key to profitability in  trading. In light of the increasing availability of financial data, prediction of price movement  in the financial market with machine learning has become a topic of interest for both  investors and researchers.. 

##project experience

""" Handling a end to end project working with teams sharing knowledge is really great in this project. We have started with dummy dataset and learned to work on real time dataset using APIs. The data cleaning or the whole exploratory data analysis which we call data preprocessing exposes us that how to shape your data for the model as required analyzing variables to distribution, missing values to creating new features from existing one. In the modeling part we analyzed the basic working of model and tuned it accordingly when it overfits or underfits. The last and most important part is the deployment one where we know how to implement things applying OOPs concepts, defining functions, using GitHub deploying model through streamlit/heroku. Designing the interface to make it user friendly explaining things in simple and efficient ways to complete the objective of the project. """

Internship Journey Experience

""" Its always great when you have goals, teams, guidance in the path of learning and real world project implementation experience. Coming out from book world theories implementing it in the real world is really fun and joy when you are passionate about something, want to be part of some core domains. I get everything as per expectations i.e lots of learning and exposure. In this journey of Internship only learning is not there I make new friends and connections also which is also a part of growth in our journey.
